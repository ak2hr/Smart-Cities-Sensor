# Smart-Cities-Sensor
Git repo for the second version of the Smart Cities floodwater measurement system.

Code for the original proejct can be found in the Legacy System folder.


# Hardware Used
- [Things Uno](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/devices/uno/) - Microcontroller used to transmit sensor readings to the Things Network.
- [Maxbotix MB7092](https://www.maxbotix.com/Ultrasonic_Sensors/MB7092.htm) - Ultrasonic sensor used to monitor rising flood levels.
- [Large 6V 3.5W Solar Panel](https://www.adafruit.com/product/500) - Renewable source of energy for prolonged operation of each device.
- [VERTER 5V USB Buck-Boost](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2190) - Boosts the solar panel's voltage output.
- [Solar Lithium Ion Charger](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=USB%2FDC%2FSolar%20Lithium%20Ion%2FPolymer%20Charger) - Converter from the Solar Panel to the battery.

# Software Used
- [The Things Network](thethingsnetwork.com) - IOT-based service to collect data and transfer to a static database.
- Heroku (TODO: ADD HOSTING SITE) - Static URL for active display of recent data readings.
